        "Building a custom dataset can be a painful process. It might take dozens or even hundreds of hours to collect images, label them, and export them in the proper format. Fortunately, Roboflow makes this process as straightforward and fast as possible. Let me show you how!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Creating project\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.\n",

        "### Step 2: Uploading images\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that we have our images and annotations added, we can Generate a Dataset Version. When Generating a Version, you may elect to add preprocessing and augmentations. This step is completely optional, however, it can allow you to significantly improve the robustness of your model.\n",
